### Summary of Changes
When the site is visited while an ad block is enabled, a pop-up is dispayed. This pop-up has a 'close' button which runs away from the mouse on a laptop; on a phone, the button runs away after being clicked. Pressing the button thrice makes it smaller each time. After the third time, pressing the 'close' button makes additional pop-ups appear on the screen, the color and content of which is randomly chosen. After it has been clicked 3 times, there is also a 1 in 4 chance that clicking on the 'close' button results in confetti.  
Waving the mouse around also causes the Lampoon's logo to grow larger. 

### Testing Changes
Since most changes relate to a pop-up that appears when an ad blocker is enabled, an ad block is required to test these edits. I use the free version of AdBlock or AdAway, both of which successfully block all of the Lampoon's ads, and which my edits were able to detect. 
The 'close' button flees from the mouse on the laptop, which might make it a bit trickier to see the other features that appear once the button is clicked. It can be cornered with slow and precise movements, or it might be easier to do testing using one of the mobile device options in the inspect menu.

### The Site Itself

### Summary of Work
My site resembles the error screen that commonly comes up on my.harvard, except clearing the cookies won't fix it. It also has a 3.14% chance of loading something else instead of the error message. 
The page's console error messages also mirror the ones of the real my.harvard page, and the detailed error message page is the same.  
Clicking on the site while it is loading will pause its reloading process, play a sound, and bring up another scene before it returns to the status quo. 

### Testing Changes

Click on the site while it is loading for a final surprise; have your volume turned up when you do this. 

*Disclaimer:  I am not nearly as obsessed with FNAF as my site implies; it was just the first thing I could think of to accompany an endless loading screen.*
